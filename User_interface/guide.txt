This program is used to simulate material data with the help
of the ase python library. The user interface is divided into 
3 different sections. The inputs/output section, the 
visualisation section and the data output section. 

In the input/output section the workflow is the following:
first choose what potential, ensemble and temperature to have
for the system. Then choose for how many time steps to simulate
and how much time between each time step.

Under "Intervals for recording attributes" it is possible to 
choose how often to record a property. For example, putting 
in the number 10 in "basic properties" will give measurement 
every 10 time steps. When everything is in order, write to the 
config file.

In the next subsection, already made materials can be downloaded.
It is also possible to create custom atom configurations. 

When a config file and an initial atom configuration has been created,
a simulation can be started. This will then simulate based on the 
settings in the configuration file.

When the simulation is done, the attributes that are recorded
can be plotted in the visualization section and if atom configurations 
are recorded a film of the atoms dynamics can be shown. Additional
information about the simulation can be found in the data output section,
labeled "Data output".
