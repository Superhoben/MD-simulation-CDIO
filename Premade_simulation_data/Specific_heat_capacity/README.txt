Content of the Premade_simulation_data Directory:
6 files: 2 Ensemble for each element, number of elements 3 ==> 2 * 3 = 6 files

General information:
Those files are a premade simulation files that was done by Issa on a 
Macbook Pro 13-inch, 2017 personal computer with CPU: Intel 2.3 GHz Dual-Core i5

Simulation time:
Around 15 minutes per simulation (1 file = 15 minutes).
