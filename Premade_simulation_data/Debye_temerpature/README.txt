6 files: 2 Ensemble for each element, number of elements 3 ==> 2 * 3 = 6 files

General information:
Those files are a premade simulation files that was done by Issa on a 
Macbook Pro 13-inch, 2017 personal computer with CPU: Intel 2.3 GHz Dual-Core i5

Simulation time:
Around 8 minutes per simulation (1 file = 8 minutes).

Simulated materials:(Source:https://next-gen.materialsproject.org)
mp-30 (Cu-copper)
mp-124 (Ag-Silver)
mp-134 (Al-Aluminum)

Ensemble: 
NVE and NVT

SimulationSettings for both ensembles: 
temperature = 600, potential = EMT, step_number = 50000, time_step = 3, friction = 0.005

RecordingIntervals:
record_energy = 10, record_temperature = 10, record_bulk_modulus = 10
